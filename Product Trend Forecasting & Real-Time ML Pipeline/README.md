# **Product Trend Forecasting & Real-Time ML Pipeline (Azure ML, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)**

This repository contains a project focused on predicting **volatility patterns** in product trends using **time series forecasting** techniques. We applied multiple forecasting models, including **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, to capture high-frequency fluctuations and improve prediction accuracy. The goal of this project is to analyze product trends and forecast potential surges in market activity. By using these models, the project demonstrates how machine learning and traditional time series techniques can be leveraged to predict market or product performance.

The **LSTM model** is deployed as a **real-time REST API** for continuous predictions and alerting, providing instant metric predictions.

## **What We Learned**

### **1. Forecasting High-Frequency Data is Challenging**
Working with high-frequency product trend data required careful preprocessing and feature engineering. Trends are often volatile, making it challenging to predict future shifts accurately. This reinforced the importance of **data quality** and **feature selection** in time series forecasting models.

### **2. LSTM Models Are Powerful for Sequence Prediction**
While traditional models like **ARIMA** and **Prophet** performed well, the **LSTM model** provided significantly better predictions due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. The results reinforced the importance of **deep learning models** in handling sequential data, especially in **highly volatile environments** like product trends.
